      "            Answer: 18863 * 1 = 18863. This is the initial step. 18863 * 10 = 188630. Moving one place value to the left multiplies by 10. 18863 * 3 = 56589. This is the result of multiplying by 3 in the units place. 18863 * 70 = 1320410. This is the result of multiplying by 70 in the tens place. 18863 * 400 = 7545200. This is the result of multiplying by 400 in the hundreds place. 18863 * 3000 = 56589000. This is the result of multiplying by 3000 in the thousands place. 18863 * 50000 = 943150000. This is the result of multiplying by 50000 in the ten thousands place. 18863 * 400000 = 7545200000. This is the result of multiplying by 400000 in the hundred thousands place. Add all the results together: 18863 + 188630 + 56589 + 1320410 + 7545200 + 56589000 + 943150000 + 7545200000. 853016873493.\n",
