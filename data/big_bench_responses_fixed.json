      "gpt-3.5-turbo": "1. Being 5 feet tall does not automatically disqualify someone from being a basketball player.\n2. Horse riding does not have a strict height requirement like basketball does.\n3. Therefore, it does not make sense to say that Keith being 5 feet tall makes him less likely to become a novice basketball player than a horse rider.\nAnswer: False",
      "gpt-4-turbo": "1. Height can influence proficiency and selection in many sports, including basketball where height is usually an advantage due to the nature of the game (hoop height, blocking, and rebounding).\n2. Horse riding, on the other hand, often does not require a specific height; in fact, shorter individuals may sometimes fare better particularly in racing and agility-based events.\n3. Being 5 feet tall is below the average height for men, which could make it more challenging to compete in basketball, especially at higher levels where height can be a more significant factor.\n4. While horse riding requires skill, control, and balance, these virtues are not heavily dependent on height.\n5. With these considerations, it's reasonable to conclude that at 5 feet tall, Keith would likely find more immediate suitability and potentially more acceptance in horse riding vs. novice basketball due to average height disadvantages in the latter.\n\nAnswer: True",
      "gemini-1.5-flash": "1.  Being 5 feet tall is short for a basketball player.  Professional basketball players are typically much taller.\n2.  Being 5 feet tall is not unusually short for a horse rider.\n3.  Height is a significant factor in success in basketball but not necessarily in horse riding.\n4.  Therefore, Keith's height makes it less likely he'll become a successful basketball player, but his height doesn't preclude him from becoming a horse rider.\n5.  The question implies a direct comparison of likelihoods, ignoring other factors like skill, interest, and opportunity.\n\nAnswer: True\n"

Comparatively, the necessity to work at a desk is much more integral to the job of an accountant than to the job of a painter.\n6. Based on typical job descriptions, an accountant would spend more time at a desk than a painter.\n\nAnswer: False",
      "gemini-1.5-flash": "1. Painters often work in studios or on location, not typically at a desk.\n2. Accountants usually work in offices and spend a significant portion of their day at a desk.\n3. Therefore, it is less probable that Al (the painter) will work at a desk than Sam (the accountant).\nAnswer: False\n"

Both married and divorced individuals can either see their children frequently or infrequently depending on various factors such as custody arrangements, living situations, and personal choices.\n\n2. Assuming Carla is married, she might be living with her partner and potentially her children as well, which could imply she might see them every day.\n\n3. Kelly being divorced does not inherently mean she sees her children less or more frequently. The custody arrangement post-divorce plays a crucial role. If she has full custody, she might see them every day, but if she shares custody, she might see them less frequently depending on the agreement.\n\n4. The statement implies that being divorced (in Kelly's case) makes it more likely to see her kids every day compared to being married (in Carla's case).

      "gpt-4-turbo": "1. Assessing the objects in question: A CD and a cracker.\n2. Considering the purpose and design of a DVD tray: A DVD tray is designed to hold and play discs such as CDs and DVDs.\n3. Evaluating the physical compatibility: A CD fits perfectly into a DVD tray as they are designed to be compatible with such media.\n4. Considering the impact of a cracker: A cracker is likely to crumble and leave debris, which could damage the internal components of the DVD player.\n5. Comparing the consequences: Putting a CD in a DVD tray, even accidentally, would not typically cause any mess or damage. However, placing a cracker might lead to crumbs and potential malfunctioning of the player due to particles interfering with the mechanisms and electronics.\n6. Conclusion about the messiness factor: Considering the lack of mess when placing a CD in the DVD tray versus the potential mess and damage by placing a cracker, it is evident that placing a cracker would indeed be far messier.\n\nAnswer: True",

Rinsing the tray suggests the cake was finished.\n\n3.  This suggests a temporal relationship: the tray rinsing happened *before* Jimmy took the last piece.  However, it's not a direct causal link.  The rinsing is a result of the cake being gone, not the cause of Jimmy taking it.\n\n4. The cause of Jimmy taking the cake is likely his desire for cake, not the tray rinsing.\n\nAnswer: False\n"

Carry over any extra amounts just as you would in elementary multiplication.\n\n3. Execute the multiplication:\n   - First, multiply 53758 by 6 (the unit digit of 13776) = 322548\n   - Next, multiply 53758 by 7 (the tens digit of 13776) = 376306. Remember to shift this result one place to the left (because it’s the tens place) = 3763060\n   - Then, multiply 53758 by 7 again (the hundreds digit of 13776) = 376306.

Calculate the Products: \n   - Multiplying 90497 by 4 (thousands place from 10034) gives: 361988.\n   - Multiplying 90497 by 0 (hundreds place) gives: 0.\n   - Multiplying 90497 by 0 (tens place) gives: 0.\n   - Multiplying 90497 by 1 (units place) gives: 90497.\n\n5. Combine All Partial Products:\n   - The partial product from the thousands place (361988) needs to be shifted left by three places (because it was originally multiplied by the thousands digit), resulting in 361988000.\n   - The partial products from the hundreds and tens places are zeros, so they contribute nothing.\n   - The units place contributes 90497.\n   - Summing these up: 361988000 + 0 + 0 + 90497.\n\n6. Finish the Calculation:\n   - Summing up the final figures: 361988000 + 90497 = 362078497.\n\nAnswer: 362078497.",

Set up the multiplication problem in the standard format, with one number above the other:\n   ```\n   56481\n   x63267\n   ```\n\n3. Multiply 56481 by each digit in 63267, starting from the rightmost digit. First, 56481 times 7 (the last digit of 63267) is calculated as follows:\n   56481 × 7 = 395367. Write this result underneath, aligned with the 7 of 63267.\n\n4. Next, multiply 56481 by the second last digit of 63267, which is 6:\n   56481 × 6 = 338886. This result is shifted one position to the left, aligning under the 6 of 63267.\n\n5. Continue the procedure for the third last digit, which is 2:\n   56481 × 2 = 112962. This result is shifted two positions to the left.\n\n6. Multiply 56481 by the next digit, which is 3:\n   56481 × 3 = 169443. This result is shifted three positions to the left.\n\n7. Multiply 56481 by the last remaining digit at the front, which is 6:\n   56481 × 6 = 338886. This result is shifted four positions to the left.\n\n8. Now add all these results together, considering their respective shifts (just like long multiplication):\n   ```\n    395367      (56481×7)\n   +3388860     (56481×6, one position left)\n   +11296200    (56481×2, two positions left)\n   +169443000   (56481×3, three positions left)\n   +3388860000  (56481×6, four positions left)\n   ------------\n    3574257427\n   ```\n\n9.

      "gpt-4-turbo": "1. Identify the numbers to be multiplied which are 17255 and 63507.\n\n2. Arrange the numbers for multiplication. We have two numbers: the first number 17255, and the second number 63507.\n\n3. Multiply the two numbers using the standard multiplication method. Begin by aligning the numbers right:\n   ```\n    17255\n×  63507\n   ```\n\n4. Perform the multiplication:\n   Multiply each digit of the bottom number by each digit of the top number in a sequential and positional manner. We'll accumulate these results per the positional requirements (units, tens, hundreds, etc.), aligned properly.\n\n5. Start with 7 (units of 63507) multiplied by each digit of 17255:\n   - 7 × 5 (units) = 35 (write down 5, carry over 3)\n   - 7 × 5 (tens) = 35; plus the carried over 3 = 38 (write down 8, carry over 3)\n   - 7 × 2 (hundreds) = 14; plus carried over 3 = 17 (write down 7, carry over 1)\n   - 7 × 7 (thousands) = 49; plus carried over 1 = 50 (write down 50)\n   Result: 120685\n\n6. Now, move to the next digit in 63507, the zero in tens place. Since multiplying by zero gives zeros, the entire series is zeros. \n   - We write down:\n     ```\n     000000\n     ```\n\n7. Next digit, 5 in the hundreds place:\n   - 5 × 5 (units) = 25 (write down 5, carry over 2)\n   - 5 × 5 (tens) = 25; plus carry over 2 = 27 (write down 7, carry over 2)\n   - 5 × 2 (hundreds) = 10; plus carried over 2 = 12 (write down 2, carry over 1)\n   - 5 × 7 (thousands) = 35; plus carried over 1 = 36 (write down 36)\n   Result shifted one position left (for hundreds): \n   ```\n   362750\n   ```\n\n8. 3 in 10000s of 63507:\n   - As we continue this for 3:\n   - 3 × 5 = 15 (write 5, carry over 1)\n   - 3 × 5 = 15; plus carry over 1 = 16 (write 6, carry over 1)\n   - 3 × 2 = 6; plus carry over 1 = 7 (write 7)\n   - 3 × 7 = 21 (write 21)\n   Result shifted two positions left:\n   ```\n   2176500\n   ```\n\n9. 6 in 100000s of 63507:\n   - 6 × 5 = 30 (write 0, carry over 3)\n   - 6 × 5 = 30; carry over 3 makes 33 (write 3, carry over 3)\n   - 6 × 2 = 12; carry over 3 makes 15 (write 5, carry over 1)\n   - 6 × 7 = 42; carry over 1 makes 43 (write 43)\n   Result shifted three positions:\n   ```\n   43515000\n   ```\n\n10.
